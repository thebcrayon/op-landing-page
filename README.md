# The Odin Project: Landing Page Assignment
This is an assignment from The Odin Project. I will take jpg images of what the site shoud look like, take what I've learned and create it from a blank slate.

## Key Practice Points:
+ Setting up and using a new git repo for commits/versioning
+ Working in with Flexbox
+ Researching best practices
